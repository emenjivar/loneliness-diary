# Loneliness diary

## About the project
Loneliness diary is a project designed to encourage introspective writing and improve emotional awareness through daily tracking of thoughts.

The idea comes from my own experience of loneliness, which i have learned to channel and regulate through writing. 

However, using physical diaries has a major drawback: the content is often too personal to risk being exposed to others. This app was born from the need for privacy â€” a diary that prioritizes confidentiality and security without sacrificing emotional writing.
